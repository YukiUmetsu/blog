This is my one of the first post about machine learning. So please be easy on me lol.

So I created a code to predict a kind of iris (a kind of flowers).

There are 3 kinds of iris in the data set and the data set includes features of iris.

- petal width & length
- sepal width & length

The model will predict which kind of iris it is from the features.
